langkahkan kakimu kawan, kita bersama
jangan anggap kau sendiri di sini
aku kan slalu ada di saat bahagia
dan saat semua terasa hampa
kita adalah keluarga bahagia
mengharap Berkah dan Rahmat dari Sang Maha
kita sanggup taklukkan problema yang ada
karena Tuhan telah berikan Rahmat-Nya

IMM Hamka berjaya tuk indonesia tercinta 2x
kunikmati semua saat2 bersama
kusyukuri sgalanya sampai menutup mata.

red hand

I know that I messed up a few times or watcha wanna call it
I know if I fell down, you'd change the way that I saw it
I put it on the line for this time only (Is that what you really want?)

I can't see that I got red hands, I'm colorblind singing (day-oh)
Don't put the blame on me, child, the damn thing gone wild (day-oh)
Never wanted to be fooling you, can't believe I was ruining you-oo
(Is that what you really want?)

Oh yeah, oh yeah-ah, that gun is loaded

That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand
That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand
The fire burns, I'm not the one with the match, man
That gun is loaded, but it's not in my hand

I've seen it all before, you back out, and everything's changing
I needed something more, you stepped down, so what are you chasing?
I'd put it on rewind for this time only (Is that what you really want?)

I realize that I got red hands, I wanna change this (day-oh)
Don't ask me why I choose to lie, I stay blind, oh (day-oh)
It's clear to me that you are fuming too, your accusations are burning through-oo
(Is that what you really want?)

---------------------------------

don't let me down

Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around

... I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down

Running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

kitchen sink

Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe
I'm a kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you
Is not a kitchen sink to me, okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something then, it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them
Could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say
They know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you, and neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand up guy
Who hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother and his head's screwed up
But that's alright
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are friend of me, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

car radio

I ponder of something great, My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire my time today

I have these thoughts, so often I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio, And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, My skin will scream reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
It is faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

Here With Me - marshmello


Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me

When you lift me up I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

Everyday
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me
